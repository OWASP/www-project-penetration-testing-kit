Are you a penetration tester or a member of a Red Team or an application security practitioner? Need a security insight on an application?  Try the PTK - an extension that makes your browser smarter.
Based on the Wappalyzer NPM module the PTK provides a piece of insightful information about a technology stack, security headers, crawled links, and domains. A detailed traffic log allows a user to repeat a request in the R-Builder or send for attacking to the R-Attacker and execute XSS, SQL, or OS Command injections on any particular request.
Macro and traffic recording, bootstrap authentication to bypass MFA/Captcha, Swagger Editor, and much more that helps in day to day application security job.
