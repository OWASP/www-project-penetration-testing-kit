Are you a penetration tester or a member of a Red Team or an application security practitioner? Need a security insight on an application?  Try the PTK - an extension that makes your browser smarter.
Based on the Wappalyzer NPM module the PTK provides a piece of insightful information about a technology stack, security headers, crawled links, and domains. A detailed traffic log allows a user to repeat a request in the R-Builder or send for attacking to the R-Attacker and execute XSS, SQL, or OS Command injections on any particular request.
Macro and traffic recording, bootstrap authentication to bypass MFA/Captcha, Swagger Editor, and much more that helps in day to day application security job.  

**VulnerableApp** is built keeping these factors in mind. This project is scalable, extensible, easier to integrate and easier to learn.
As solving the above issue requires addition of various vulnerabilities, hence it becomes a very good platform to learn various security vulnerabilities.
