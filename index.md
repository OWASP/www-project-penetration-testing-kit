**The OWASP Penetration Testing Kit (PTK)** browser extension is your all-in-one solution for streamlining your daily AppSec tasks. Whether you’re a penetration tester, a Red Team member, or an AppSec practitioner, OWASP PTK enhances your efficiency and provides deep insights into your target application.

**Key Features:**

* **Runtime Scanning (DAST & IAST & SAST & SCA):**
  Perform Dynamic Application Security Testing, Static Analysis, In-Browser IAST and Software Composition Analysis on the fly. Identify SQL injection, command injection, reflected/stored XSS, SQL auth bypass, XPath injections, JWT attacks, and other complex threats.

* **Static Analysis (SAST):**
  PTK automatically parses loaded JavaScript, HTML, and CSS right in your browser—before any code ever runs. It flags unsafe patterns like `eval()`, `innerHTML`/`outerHTML` injection, insecure cryptographic calls, missing input sanitization, and common anti-patterns. 

* **In-Browser IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing):**
  PTK’s built-in IAST engine instruments your app at runtime—right in the browser—tracking taint flows and code execution to flag vulnerabilities as they occur. Catch issues like DOM-based XSS, unsafe `eval`/`innerHTML` usage, open-redirects, and more without leaving your dev tools.

* **JWT Inspector:**
  Analyze, craft, and tamper with JSON Web Tokens. Generate keys, test null signatures, brute-force HMAC secrets, and inject malicious `jwk`, `jku`, or `kid` parameters.

* **Insightful Application Info:**
  One-click visibility into tech stacks, WAFs, security headers, crawled links, and authentication flows.

* **Built-in Proxy & Traffic Log:**
  Capture all HTTP(S) traffic, replay requests in R-Builder, and automate XSS, SQLi, and OS command injection.

* **R-Builder for Request Tampering & Smuggling:**
  Craft and manipulate HTTP requests, including complex request-smuggling techniques. Now with cURL import/export.

* **Cookie Management:**
  Add, edit, remove, block, protect, export, and import cookies from a powerful in-browser editor.

* **Decoder/Encoder Utility:**
  Instantly convert between UTF-8, Base64, MD5, URL-encode/decode, and more formats.

* **Swagger.IO Integration:**
  Browse and interact with API endpoints directly from your Swagger documentation.

* **Selenium Integration:**
  Shift left security by running automated Selenium tests with built-in vulnerability checks.

Enhance your AppSec practice with PTK—the extension that makes your browser smarter and your testing faster. Install today and start uncovering vulnerabilities in real time!
